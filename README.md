Airbnb Clone Project
Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project aims to build a robust backend system that mirrors the core functionality of Airbnb. This includes user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and secure payment processing. The goal is to design a scalable, secure, and maintainable backend that supports real-world use cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Goals

Build a scalable backend to support user interactions, property listings, and bookings.
Implement secure authentication and authorization.
Design an efficient database schema to handle complex relationships.
Provide a REST and GraphQL API for seamless frontend integration.
Set up automated testing and CI/CD pipelines to maintain code quality.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Team Roles

Backend Developer: Implements core application logic, API endpoints, authentication, and business rules.

Database Administrator: Designs and maintains the database schema, ensures data integrity, optimizes queries, and handles migrations.

Frontend Developer: Builds the user interface, consumes backend APIs, and ensures smooth user experience.

DevOps Engineer: Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages deployments, monitors system performance, and ensures reliability.

Project Manager: Oversees timelines, coordinates tasks, manages communication, and ensures deliverables meet deadlines.

QA Engineer: Designs test cases, performs automated and manual testing, and ensures software quality before deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technology Stack

Django - A Python web framework for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic efficiently.

Django - REST Framework (DRF)	Extends Django to build flexible, browsable REST APIs.

PostgreSQL - A powerful, open-source relational database to store structured data like users, bookings, and properties.

GraphQL	- Provides a flexible query language for clients to fetch data exactly as needed.

Docker	- Containerizes the application for consistent development and deployment across environments.

GitHub Actions	- Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows as part of CI/CD.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Database Design 

Key Entities and Fields
User: id (Primary Key), username, email, password_hash, role (e.g., guest, host, admin)

Property: id, title, description, location, price_per_night, host_id (FK to User)

Booking: id, property_id (FK to Property), user_id (FK to User), start_date, end_date

Review: id, property_id (FK to Property), user_id (FK to User), rating, comment

Payment: id, booking_id (FK to Booking), amount, status (e.g., pending, completed, failed), transaction_date

Relationships
A User can host multiple Properties.
A User can book multiple Properties.
A Booking is linked to one Property and one User.
A Property can have multiple Reviews.
Each Booking has one Payment record.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature Breakdown

User Management	- Handles user registration, authentication (JWT), profile management, and role-based access.

Property Management	- Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with images and pricing.

Booking System	- Allows users to view availability, make bookings, and manage their reservations.

Reviews & Ratings	- Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties, helping build trust.

Payment Processing -	Handles secure transactions for bookings, including payment status updates and error handling.

Search & Filter	- Supports searching for properties by location, price, and amenities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API Security

Authentication - Ensures only authorized users can access protected endpoints.

AuthorizatioN - Enforces role-based access (e.g., only hosts can modify their properties).

Rate Limiting -	Prevents abuse and protects the API from DDoS attacks.

Input Validation & Sanitization	- Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and data corruption.

HTTPS & Secure Headers - Encrypts data in transit and mitigates common attacks.


Security is crucial to protect user data, prevent unauthorized actions, and ensure payment safety.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates building, testing, and deploying the application to ensure rapid and reliable releases.

Why Itâ€™s Important
+ Ensures code quality through automated tests and linting.
+ Speeds up deployment and reduces human error.
+ Encourages team collaboration by catching issues early.

Tools
- GitHub Actions for automated workflows.
- Docker for consistent deployments.
- pytest for automated testing.
- Optional: Heroku / Render / AWS for deployment.
